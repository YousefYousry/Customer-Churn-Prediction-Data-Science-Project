This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains customer demographic, financial, and account activity data.
We performed data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and detecting/removing outliers using z-score.
Three algorithms were implemented: Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, chosen for their performance with numerical data and ability to handle non-linear relationships.
The results provide insights into churn patterns, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
Key Features:

1) Data cleaning and preprocessing

2) One-hot encoding and label encoding

3) Outlier detection using z-score

4) Model training and comparison (Random Forest, SVM, KNN)

5) Predictive analysis for churn risk
